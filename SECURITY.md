To report a security vulnerability, please follow these steps:

3. Include as much information as possible, including:
   - A description of the vulnerability
   - Steps to reproduce the issue

   - Any potential solutions you may have identified

- We will acknowledge receipt of your vulnerability report within 48 hours.
- We will provide a more detailed response within 7 days, indicating the next steps in handling your report.
- We will keep you informed about our progress in addressing the vulnerability.

## Guidelines

- Do not perform actions that could harm the reliability or integrity of our services or data.
