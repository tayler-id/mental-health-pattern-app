# Mobile App Debugging Notes

## Current System Overview

After reviewing the Memory Bank and code files, I've identified that a mobile app component has been added to the Mental Health Pattern Recognition Assistant project, but it's not fully documented in the Memory Bank files.

### Components:

1. **React Native Frontend** (`mobile/app/index.js`):
   - Built with React Native and Expo
   - Simple UI with menu options
   - Records mood data with level, notes, and emotions
   - Has a streak and points system for gamification
   - Modal for data entry

2. **Node.js Server** (`mobile/server/index.js`):
   - Express server running on port 3000
   - Receives data from the React Native app
   - Uses PythonShell to execute Python code from the main application
   - Updates streak counter (capped at 7)

## Issues Identified

The primary issue appears to be in the communication between the React Native app and the Node.js server:

1. **Server-side Issues**:
   - The PythonShell.runString uses template literals inside a string, which likely causes issues with variable interpolation
   - The script tries to reference variables like `${mood_level}` and `${notes}` within a string, which won't work correctly
   - Error handling may be insufficient to provide clear feedback to the frontend

2. **Frontend Issues**:
   - The app expects a server running on localhost:3000, which may not be accessible from a mobile device
   - Error handling in the fetch request could be improved
   - The `ding.mp3` sound is referenced but commented out in the code

## Next Steps for Debugging

1. Fix the server-side PythonShell execution:
   - Replace the template string approach with proper parameter passing
   - Ensure the Python execution path is correct for the operating environment

2. Improve error handling on both sides:
   - Add more detailed logging
   - Provide clearer error messages to the user

3. Test the connection between the app and server:
   - Ensure the server is accessible from the device running the app
   - Verify network connectivity and port access

4. Verify data flow:
   - Confirm the data is correctly passed from the frontend to the server
   - Ensure the server correctly communicates with the Python backend

This document will be updated as debugging progresses.
