# Mental Health Pattern Recognition Assistant - Project Brief

## Project Overview

The Mental Health Pattern Recognition Assistant is a comprehensive application designed to help users track, analyze, and visualize their mental health data. The application identifies patterns and correlations between various factors affecting mental wellbeing, providing personalized insights and recommendations.

## Core Requirements

1. **Data Collection**
   - Track mood levels (1-10 scale) with associated emotions
   - Record activities (exercise, social, work, etc.) with duration and intensity
   - Log sleep data (duration, quality)
   - Track medication intake
   - Support custom data entry for user-defined tracking categories

2. **Pattern Recognition**
   - Identify time-based patterns (time of day, day of week)
   - Detect trends in mood over time
   - Recognize mood clusters and distinct patterns
   - Analyze correlations between activities and mood
   - Analyze correlations between sleep and mood

3. **Advanced Analysis**
   - Perform lagged correlation analysis to identify delayed effects
   - Conduct Granger causality testing to identify potential causal relationships
   - Analyze multivariate relationships between different factors
   - Detect cyclical patterns in mood data

4. **Visualization**
   - Generate mood timelines
   - Create activity-mood correlation visualizations
   - Produce sleep-mood correlation visualizations
   - Visualize emotion distributions
   - Generate comprehensive dashboards

5. **User Interface**
   - Provide a command-line interface for data entry and interaction
   - Display visualizations and insights
   - Support data export and import
   - Allow configuration of application settings

## Goals

1. **Primary Goals**
   - Help users identify factors that positively or negatively affect their mood
   - Provide data-driven insights about mental health patterns
   - Enable users to make informed decisions about lifestyle changes
   - Support mental health self-management and awareness

2. **Secondary Goals**
   - Create a foundation for potential integration with other health tracking systems
   - Establish a framework that could be extended to include additional data sources
   - Develop algorithms that could potentially assist in early detection of mood disorders
   - Build a tool that could complement professional mental health care

## Success Criteria

1. The application successfully collects and stores various types of mental health data
2. Pattern recognition algorithms identify meaningful patterns in user data
3. Correlation analysis accurately detects relationships between different factors
4. Visualizations clearly communicate patterns and insights
5. Users receive actionable insights based on their personal data
6. The application maintains user privacy and data security
7. The interface is intuitive and encourages regular use

## Constraints

1. The application is currently command-line based, limiting accessibility for non-technical users
2. Analysis quality depends on consistent data entry by users
3. Insights are correlational, not necessarily causal
4. The application is not a substitute for professional mental health care
5. Pattern recognition requires sufficient data to be effective (typically several weeks)

## Future Considerations

1. Development of a graphical user interface
2. Mobile application for easier data entry
3. Integration with wearable devices for passive data collection
4. Machine learning enhancements for more sophisticated pattern recognition
5. Collaborative features for sharing insights with healthcare providers
