## Active Decisions and Considerations

### 1. Mobile App Architecture

**Decision Point**: How to structure the mobile application and its communication with the backend.

**Considerations**:
- React Native provides cross-platform capabilities
- Need for a server intermediary between the mobile app and Python backend
- Data synchronization between mobile and main application
- Offline capabilities for mobile usage

**Current Direction**: Implemented a React Native mobile app with Expo and a Node.js Express server that communicates with the Python backend. The server uses PythonShell to execute Python scripts and return results to the mobile app. Added offline storage with AsyncStorage and network connectivity monitoring with NetInfo. The app can now work without an internet connection and synchronize data when connectivity is restored.

### 2. User Interface Evolution

**Decision Point**: Whether to maintain the current command-line interface or develop a graphical user interface.

**Considerations**:
- Command-line interface limits accessibility for non-technical users
- GUI development would require significant additional work
- Web-based interface could provide cross-platform accessibility
- Mobile interface would enable on-the-go data entry

**Current Direction**: A basic GUI prototype has been implemented using Tkinter. This provides a foundation for further GUI development while maintaining the command-line interface for users who prefer it. Additionally, a mobile app is being developed to enable on-the-go data entry, with offline capabilities now implemented.

### 3. Data Storage Approach

**Decision Point**: Whether to continue with the JSON-based file storage or migrate to a database system.

**Considerations**:
- JSON storage is simple and requires no additional dependencies
- Database would provide better performance for larger datasets
- SQLite could offer a good compromise (file-based but with database capabilities)
- Migration would require significant refactoring of the DataCollector

**Current Direction**: Continue with JSON storage for now, but design a migration path to SQLite for a future update. The mobile app now uses AsyncStorage for local data persistence to enable offline functionality.

### 4. Analysis Algorithm Enhancements

**Decision Point**: Which additional analysis algorithms to implement.

**Considerations**:
- More sophisticated machine learning approaches could provide deeper insights
- Advanced time series analysis could better detect complex patterns
- Natural language processing could analyze text notes
- Additional algorithms increase complexity and computational requirements

**Current Direction**: Focus on enhancing existing algorithms before adding new ones, with priority on improving the accuracy and relevance of insights.

### 5. Visualization Improvements

**Decision Point**: How to enhance the visualization capabilities.

**Considerations**:
- Interactive visualizations would provide better user experience but require a GUI
- Additional visualization types could provide different perspectives on the data
- Customizable visualizations would allow users to focus on what matters to them
- Enhanced aesthetics could improve engagement

**Current Direction**: Implement additional static visualization types and improve the aesthetics of existing ones.

### 6. Privacy and Security

**Decision Point**: How to enhance privacy and security of sensitive mental health data.

**Considerations**:
- Local storage already provides good privacy (no data transmission)
- File encryption could protect data at rest
- Password protection could prevent unauthorized access
- Anonymization features for data export could enhance privacy

**Current Direction**: Implement basic file encryption and add anonymization options for data export. For the mobile app, all offline data is stored locally on the device using AsyncStorage.

## Current Challenges

1. **Data Entry Burden**: Regular manual data entry can be burdensome for users, potentially leading to inconsistent data collection.

2. **Analysis Quality with Limited Data**: Pattern recognition and correlation analysis require sufficient data to provide meaningful insights, which can be challenging for new users.

3. **Insight Actionability**: Translating statistical patterns into actionable insights that genuinely help users improve their mental health remains challenging.

4. **Technical Accessibility**: The command-line interface and installation requirements limit accessibility for non-technical users who could benefit from the application.

5. **Validation of Effectiveness**: Without formal validation studies, it's difficult to quantify the actual impact of the application on users' mental health outcomes.

6. **Mobile-Desktop Integration**: Ensuring seamless data synchronization between the mobile app and desktop application is technically challenging but has been addressed with offline storage and sync functionality.

## Immediate Priorities

1. Continue enhancing the mobile application's functionality
2. Implement the remaining menu options in the mobile app
3. Add support for additional data types in the mobile app
4. Update memory bank documentation to reflect the addition of offline storage
5. Review the codebase for potential improvements
6. Develop a plan for addressing the most pressing challenges
7. Identify quick wins that could enhance user experience with minimal effort
