## Development Setup

### Environment Setup

1. **Python Environment**:
   - Python 3.6 or higher
   - Virtual environment recommended (venv or conda)

2. **Dependencies Installation**:
   ```bash
   pip install numpy pandas matplotlib seaborn scipy scikit-learn statsmodels tabulate
   ```

3. **Directory Structure**:

   ```

### Development Workflow

1. **Code Organization**:
   - Each major component has its own module
   - Clear separation between data, analysis, and presentation layers
   - Consistent naming conventions and code style

2. **Testing Approach**:
   - Unit tests for individual components
   - Integration tests for component interactions
   - Test data generation for consistent testing

3. **Version Control**:
   - Git-based version control
   - Feature branch workflow
   - Semantic versioning for releases

## Technical Constraints

### Performance Considerations

1. **Data Volume Limitations**:
   - The JSON-based storage works efficiently for typical personal use (1-2 years of daily data)
   - Performance may degrade with very large datasets (5+ years of high-frequency data)
   - Analysis algorithms are optimized for datasets with hundreds to thousands of entries

2. **Computational Intensity**:
   - Some analysis algorithms (particularly clustering and causality testing) are computationally intensive
   - Visualization generation can be memory-intensive with large datasets
   - The application is designed to run on consumer hardware with reasonable performance

3. **Memory Usage**:
   - Data is loaded into memory for analysis
   - Visualization generation can temporarily increase memory usage
   - Typical usage requires <500MB RAM

### Platform Compatibility

1. **Operating System Compatibility**:
   - Cross-platform (Windows, macOS, Linux)
   - Command-line interface works across all supported platforms
   - File paths are handled in a platform-agnostic way

2. **Python Version Requirements**:
   - Requires Python 3.6+
   - Tested primarily on Python 3.8 and 3.9
   - Uses type hints (introduced in Python 3.5, enhanced in 3.6+)

3. **Display Requirements**:
   - Command-line interface requires a terminal with color support for optimal experience
   - Visualizations are saved as PNG files viewable on any platform

### Security and Privacy

1. **Data Storage**:
   - All data is stored locally
   - No network connectivity required
   - No data sharing or cloud storage

2. **Privacy Considerations**:
   - Sensitive mental health data remains on the user's device
   - No user identification or authentication required
   - Export functionality includes options to anonymize data

## Dependencies

### External Dependencies

   - pytest (for running tests)

### Internal Dependencies

1. **Component Dependencies**:
   - All components depend on the DataCollector
   - Visualization depends on analysis components for data
   - UserInterface depends on all other components

2. **Data Dependencies**:
   - Analysis components require sufficient data for meaningful results
   - Pattern recognition typically requires at least 2 weeks of data
   - Correlation analysis works best with 30+ days of data
   - Advanced analyses (causality, cycles) need 60+ days of data

## Technical Debt and Limitations

1. **Current Technical Debt**:
   - Command-line interface limits accessibility
   - Limited error handling in some edge cases
   - Some analysis algorithms could be optimized further
   - Visualization customization options are limited

   - Limited export formats (JSON only)
   - No multi-user support
   - No cloud synchronization
   - Limited internationalization support

3. **Future Technical Considerations**:
   - Migration to a proper database for improved performance with larger datasets
   - Development of a graphical user interface
   - API development for integration with other systems
   - Enhanced data import/export capabilities
   - Mobile application development
