## Overview

The Mental Health Pattern Recognition Assistant is a powerful tool designed to help individuals track, analyze, and visualize their mental health data. By identifying patterns and correlations between various factors affecting mental wellbeing, the application provides personalized insights that can help users make informed decisions about their mental health.

Unlike generic mood tracking apps, this assistant uses advanced statistical analysis and pattern recognition algorithms to uncover hidden relationships between your activities, sleep, medication, and mood - helping you understand what truly impacts your mental wellbeing.

## Key Features

- **Comprehensive Data Collection**
  - Track mood levels (1-10) with associated emotions
  - Record activities with duration and intensity
  - Log sleep quality and duration
  - Track medication intake and adherence
  - Create custom tracking categories

- **Advanced Pattern Recognition**
  - Identify time-based patterns (time of day, day of week)
  - Detect trends and cycles in mood over time
  - Recognize mood clusters and distinct patterns
  - Analyze correlations between activities and mood
  - Perform lagged correlation analysis to identify delayed effects

- **Insightful Visualizations**
  - Generate mood timelines and emotion distributions
  - Create correlation visualizations between different factors
  - Produce comprehensive dashboards with key insights
  - Visualize weekly and monthly patterns

- **Personalized Insights**
  - Receive data-driven insights about your mental health patterns
  - Get suggestions for potential mood-improving activities
  - Understand your unique emotional patterns and triggers
  - Identify factors that consistently impact your wellbeing
